                <li>1 large pot of simmering water</li>
                <li>10ml of vinegar</li>
                <li>6 eggs</li>
                <li>Toast or hard bread</li>
                <li>Avocado</li>
                <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
                <li>Slotted spoon</li>        
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps: Time to take the plunge</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Crack an egg into a separate bowl</li>
                <li>Put the vinegar into the simmering water</li>
                <li>Place slotted spoon just in the water and slide egg onto it </li>
                <li>Dip the spoon under the water with a swirl</li>
                <li>Allow the egg to stay in boiling water (the longer the more solid the yolk)</li>
                <li>Spoon off any excess egg white floating on the surface</li>
                <li>I do 1 egg at a time, but feel free to be adventurous</li>
                <li>Repeat as many times as you have eggs</li>
                <li>Prep the bread/Toast with your choice (butter, avocado, salt and pepper)</li>
                <li>Remove the egg and slide it onto the bread and enjoy</li>
            </ol>
